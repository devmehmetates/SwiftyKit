# Contributing to SwiftyKit
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. How is this flow?

- Fork the repository and create your branch from the main partition.
- If you've added code that needs testing, add tests.
- Update documentation if you've changed APIs (It's almost a requirement in this repo specific)
- Make sure the test packet has passed.
- Publish the pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can. My stackoverflow question includes sample code that anyone with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

Use Builder Pattern Based Codes
